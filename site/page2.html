		<p class="one">We are a FRC Robotics Team. FRC stands for First Robotics Cooperation. We start the year off with a kick-off in January and then we have 6 weeks to build a robot with fellow team members. After the 6 week period is up, we then bag it up and have a total of 6 more hours to finalize things on the robot. Once that is done, we are ready for the competition!<p>

		<p class="zero">There are 2 competitions a year. One is a main season in March-April. That lasts for 2 days. There is also a off-season one that we attend in November. It's called Ramp-Riot. Ramp-Riot is basically a learning expierence for the freshman that have just joined the Robotics Team.<p> 

		<h1><center><i>The Robotics Course</i></h1></center>
		<p class="zero">The Robotics Course offers a learning expierence for people who are interested in the Engineering, Science, and technology fields. Mr. Fiocco, as the teacher, teaches a small course designed to teach <i>Freshman, Junior, and Seniors</i> the basics. They work with small, basic robots to learn how things work on the robot. The small robots include the same components that are used on the main, Robotics club robot. The students are also taught and given a basic knowledge of the C programming language.</p>
